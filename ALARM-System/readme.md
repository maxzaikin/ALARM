# ALARM: Applicant Loan Analyzer for Risk Management

## **Project Overview**
The ALARM system (Applicant Loan Analyzer for Risk Management) is a web-based application designed to predict and assess the risk level of loan applicants. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, ALARM empowers financial institutions to make data-driven decisions, minimize risks, and optimize loan approval processes.

## **Objective**
The primary goal of the ALARM project is to provide an efficient and scalable solution for evaluating loan applications by:
- Analyzing applicant data.
- Generating risk predictions based on pre-trained machine learning models.
- Offering a user-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.
- Supporting cross-platform deployment on various operating systems.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Powered by .NET 8.0 and Docker containers, the application runs seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Frontend:** A responsive, interactive web interface built using React for a modern user experience.
- **Backend:** An ASP.NET Core-based REST API for data processing and model inference.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Includes support for ML.NET or Python-based ML models wrapped as REST APIs.
- **Secure Deployment:** HTTPS configuration, container support, and OpenAPI documentation for secure and standardized API usage.
- **Test-Driven Development:** Comprehensive backend and frontend test coverage using xUnit and Jest.
